**Title**: *Towards an Ethical Framework for Publishing Twitter Data in Social Research: Taking into Account Usersâ€™ Views, Online Context and Algorithmic Estimation.*

**Authors**: Matthew L Williams, Pete Burnap, Luke Sloan.


## Key Points
1. explore social media ethics in research output-- specifically **publishing** original Twitter content 
2. understand user perceptions and expectations
3. suggestions for social media researchers

## Synopsis
* Twitter has an abundance of data that many researchers are attracted to.
* But social media research so far has conducted studies and published data/results without showing any effort to anonymize the (sensitive) data or to obtain informed consent from the users whose data is being used.
* Legal consent may be embedded in Twitter's Terms of Use, but researchers should assume a reflexive approach guided by ethical concerns.

### User Perceptions
* A variety of independent variables influence the following dependent variables characterizing privacy concerns:
  1. Concern when used in academic research, government, and commercial contexts
  2. Expectations of Anonymity and Informed Consent

* Result: 
  * many users don't express as much concern about the use of their data in research context, BUT...
  * most expected to be asked for consent and anonymity when their content is published.
  * *there is a disconnect between social researchers' current practices and Twitter users' perceptions.*
* The results of this survey (of users' privacy expectations and preferences) supports the authors' argument that researchers who directly quote Twitter users' content **should obtain informed consent** to do so, while **explicitly stating** some caveats that arise due to Twitter's Broadcasting Guidelines.

### Disjuncture between current research practices and Twitter users' expectations
* Perceptions of what is public in online communications
* Twitter blurs boundary between public and private
* result of:
  * disinhibition by computer-mediated communication
    * People acknowledge that the online space is somewhat public, but often engage in private talk.
  * context collapse
    * Twitter folds multiple audiences into a flattened context
    * Users intend to share content with an "imagined limited audience", when this content is actually exposed to a much larger audience.
  * unintended and unexpected information flows

### Potential Harms
* Sensitive classifications (like hate speech, or models that unintentionally show associations between sexual orientation, ethnicity, etc.) may stigmatize users
* Stigmatization can lead to further harms.

### Tensions
#### ML models
* To ensure power and longevity, be transparent about how these models are being trained and on what data. Aim for reproducibility.
  * There are ethical consequences to training and releasing models that are inaccurate and could be used with bad intentions in other contexts
* HOWEVER- how do we balance this with the privacy of Twitter users? --> seek informed consent for all direct quoted content.

 #### Anonymity and Twitter's Broadcasting guidelines
* Users should be aware of (through consent negotiations) limitations in anonymization due to Twitter's guidelines

### Suggestions
* Flow chart
* How to ask for consent (nuances/details to include)
